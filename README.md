# Landing-Page-Odin-Project-

My first project created from scratch via The Odin Project's foundation course, at the end of HTML/CSS section.

I will use this as a bit of a comprehensive blog/notebook/journal of my progress and challenges I face within this task, over and above the detail of the regular commit messages.

Day 1 (10pm - 17 Oct 2022)

My first step is to create the basic boilerplate and high level layout/sections of my page, after which I will commit.

Update - First mistake made already, I typed out the same thing 4 times rather than once and copy pasting it down. Need to stop bad habits early.

Update - did my first commit. My plan for this one (I dont know whether right or wrong approach yet) is to have a separate header and section 1 despite the colours being the same.

Quick note - 'Hero' refers to the first big title/text in a website, I didn't know that until now. Will use this as a class tag going forward I think?

Update - I noticed that I'll only use UL once so I wont currently think to name them as classes or put them in Div's. I'm assuming this will be ok for this exercise.

Update - used an online screen scraper to take the text from the picture in the font&colours reference to paste in here and be able to copy/paste easier for quickness later.

Update - added the content for section 2. Assuming as its identical I wont need to make a distinction between containers as they'll all be formatted in the same way. The Image alt label will hopefully help me keep track of order etc until I decide what to put in. Time to commit.

Update - I added the HTML layout for the remaining sections, and noticed that it might make more sense to wrap the hero, text and button in a container for easier placement and control in section 1. Time to commit.

Break - (11pm - 17 Oct 2022)

=============================================================================================================

DAY 2 - 7pm - 18 Oct 2022

Here we go again. Now that the basic HTML Layout is done, my goal for the next couple hours is to get the CSS layout the way it needs to be. If not with the styling, at least with the flexbox placements. lets begin.

Update - an observation which I really think I need to keep at the forefront of my mind when debugging on CSS.. check to see if its a class which requires a '.' or whether its an element I am declaring in the stylesheet. Maybe worth me looking up whether it's best practice to always declare a class, and to what extent/specificity.

Update - being tripped up slightly by the section layouts. Trying to get footer to stick to the bottom and the 100vh is showiing a slight scroll wheel and I'm trying to find out why thats happening.

Update - did some googling and found out how to fix it (I think). added html to body for the margin/padding top bottom set to 0% rule. I'm using flexbox to space out my sections at a ratio of 1, 30, 1 for the header main and footer but not sure whats best practice here. My plan is to see if that approach works for other sections too. Quick commit first.

Update - went a bit AWOL and found out how to make a GIF the background of my website. Not sure if this is tacky yet, will need to see how it pans out.

===================================================================================================

DAY 3 - 10:30pm

I decided I hated the first design so starting again from scratch, trying to limit my use of flexboxes where possible after watching another video or two. This commit has the basic html only so far.

===================================================================================================

DAY 4 - I abandoned the journal idea as it was a bit time consuming. Today (20th October) marks the completion of the page. It's complete for the purposes of moving on with the course but I will definitely tinker around and add a couple new features to it, graphical enhancements etc.

Time started c.6pm - time completed c.12:30am. Neck is sore. Time for bed!
