# Landing-Page-Odin-Project-
My first project created from scratch via The Odin Project's foundation course, at the end of HTML/CSS section. 

I will use this as a bit of a comprehensive blog/notebook/journal of my progress and challenges I face within this task, over and above the detail of the regular commit messages. 

My first step is to create the basic boilerplate and high level layout/sections of my page, after which I will commit. 

Update - First mistake made already, I typed out the same thing 4 times rather than once and copy pasting it down.  Need to stop bad habits early.  

Update - did my first commit. My plan for this one (I dont know whether right or wrong approach yet) is to have a separate header and section 1 despite the colours being the same.  

Quick note - 'Hero' refers to the first big title/text in a website, I didn't know that until now. Will use this as a class tag going forward I think?

Update - I noticed that I'll only use UL once so I wont currently think to name them as classes or put them in Div's. I'm assuming this will be ok for this exercise. 

Update - used an online screen scraper to take the text from the picture in the font&colours reference to paste in here and be able to copy/paste easier for quickness later.

Update - added the content for section 2.  Assuming as its identical I wont need to make a distinction between containers as they'll all be formatted in the same way.  The Image alt label will hopefully help me keep track of order etc until I decide what to put in. Time to commit. 

Update - I added the HTML layout for the remaining sections, and noticed that it might make more sense to wrap the hero, text and button in a container for easier placement and control in section 1. Time to commit.
